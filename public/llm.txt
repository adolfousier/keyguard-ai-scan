# KeyGuard AI Scan - LLM Context

## Project Overview
KeyGuard AI Scan is a comprehensive open-source automated penetration testing platform that performs deep web application security assessments following OWASP, PTES, and NIST methodologies.

## Key Penetration Testing Features
- **7+ Active Test Categories**: Security headers, CORS, SSL/TLS, directory traversal, debug endpoints, information disclosure, server fingerprinting
- **Security Header Assessment**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options analysis
- **Technology Stack Fingerprinting**: Framework detection, dependency mapping, attack surface analysis
- **Credential Discovery**: Pattern-based detection of exposed API keys across 100+ services
- **AI-Powered Exploit Analysis**: Attack vector prioritization, vulnerability chaining, remediation roadmaps
- **OWASP Compliant Reports**: Professional pentest reports with CVSS scoring and compliance validation
- **Rust-Powered Engine**: High-performance security scanning with memory safety

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui
- Backend: Rust (Axum framework), LibSQL database
- AI: NEURA_ROUTER (OpenAI-compatible) for penetration testing analysis
- Scanning Engine: Advanced pattern recognition with entropy analysis
- Testing Framework: 7+ comprehensive penetration testing modules

## Penetration Testing Methodology
Following OWASP Testing Guide, PTES, and NIST Framework:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Technology fingerprinting, service enumeration
2. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Active security testing across 7+ categories
3. **Analysis**: Risk-based prioritization with CVSS scoring
4. **Reporting**: Executive summaries with remediation roadmaps
